            bio: `Edgar Allan Poe 
            (né Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) 
            was an American writer, poet, author, editor, 
            and literary critic who is best known for his poetry 
            and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery 
            and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central 
            figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the 
            United States, and of American literature.[1] 
            Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners 
            of the short story, and is considered the inventor of 
            the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant 
            contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.[2] 
            He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living 
            through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[3]`
